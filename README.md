password generator

#Description
This is a password generator. User presses the generate button to create a secure, random password. The user can select a password length from 8 characters up to 128 characters long. Users can also indicate which kind of characters they want included in the password: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, special characters. A user may select one, any combination, or all character types. The generator creates and displays a random password, which has been shuffled prior to display for an added level of security and randomization.
